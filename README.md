## Task:

display all the beers from the Brewdog Api in a card format. If you click on a beer card, you will be taken to a further details page, which displays more detail around the ingredients in the beer.

## API:

https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers - returns all beers

- Each beer card should display the name and description, and on hover show the tagline.
- A button to toggle show/hide beers that are brewed before or on 2010
- Use React router to click on a beer card and then display the following further information on a separate page: 'ph', 'food_pairing', 'brewers_tips', and the 'method' - the method includes child elements, so make sure they're displayed too.

## Tech:

- JS/React/React router (2 pages: home & further details)

Note: No design systems such as material, bootstrap, etc should be used.

In terms of styling, generic card styling will work, Bootstrap have a good example: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/ - where the image is first, then the title, then the description and a button (which can be hooked up to navigate to the further details). When it comes to styling the further details page, don't go too heavy on styling, just showing the details is more important, a generic box will work for styling.

Nice to have but not necessary: further filtering options on the homepage.

Please don't spend more than 2 hours on this task.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
